\subsection{Estimate Conditional Predictive Demographic Disparity without Testing Labels} 

In this section, we evaluate Algorithm \ref{alg:prediction} 
for the conditional predictive disparity on the Crime 
Community data set. 

We examined the disparity between African American (AA) 
and non-African American  (nAA) communities. The former 
are those with feature ``percentage of population that 
is African American'' above 50\%, and the latter 
are the rest communities. 

Recall $\gamma_{\pm}$ are the ratios 
that characterize conditional predictive demographic 
disparity. Let $\tilde{\gamma}_{\pm}$ be the reversed 
testing ratios. The estimation quality of 
$\gamma_{\pm}(f; S)$ on $\gamma_{\pm}(f; Q)$ is 
\begin{equation}
\Delta_{tr} = | \gamma_{\pm}(f; Q) - \gamma_{\pm}(f; S)|, 
\end{equation}
and the quality of $\tilde{\gamma}_{\pm}(f; S)$ 
on $\gamma_{\pm}(f; Q)$ is 
\begin{equation}
\Delta_{retr} = | \gamma_{\pm}(f; Q) 
- \tilde{\gamma}_{\pm}(f; S)|.  
\end{equation}
Results are shown in Table \ref{exp1:disparity}.  
We see $\tilde{\gamma}_{\pm}(f; S)$ are 
more accurate estimate of $\gamma_{\pm}(f; Q)$ 
than $\gamma_{\pm}(f; S)$ in most cases, with 
an exception with logistic regression.
