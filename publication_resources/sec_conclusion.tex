\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we propose a new approach to estimate 
prediction qualities on unlabeled testing sample. 
We show this approach gives a more accurate estimate of 
testing qualities than traditional training qualities 
in both classification and anomaly detection tasks, 
under four common quality metrics including 
classification error, f1-score, predictive demographic 
disparity and AUC score.
